# nearest_neighbor_algorithm
This program uses the nearest neighbor algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem.

To use the program:
-------------------
Run the python file.
Input the number of rows your graph has.

Input the graph from left to right, hitting [ENTER] after each digit, and ***replacing each hyphen with a zero***.

Designate the starting vertex as a character (case insensitive).

The alorithm computes the total cost of the trip and the vertices traversed with the inputted information, then closes.
